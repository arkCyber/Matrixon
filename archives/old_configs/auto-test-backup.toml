# =============================================================================
#  This is the official example config for matrixon.
#  If you use it for your server, you will need to adjust it to your own needs.
#  At the very least, change the server_name field!
# =============================================================================


[global]
# The server_name is the pretty name of this server. It is used as a suffix for user
# and room ids. Examples: matrix.org, matrixon.rs

# The matrixon server needs all /_matrix/ requests to be reachable at
# https://your.server.name/ on port 443 (client-server) and 8448 (federation).

# If that's not possible for you, you can create /.well-known files to redirect
# requests. See
# https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#get-well-known-matrix-client
# and
# https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.4#get-well-known-matrix-server
# for more information, or continue below to see how matrixon can do this for you.

# YOU NEED TO EDIT THIS
server_name = "localhost"

# PostgreSQL backend for high performance and scalability
database_backend = "sqlite"
# PostgreSQL connection string - update with your database credentials
database_path = "./data/matrixon.db"

# The port matrixon will be running on. You need to set up a reverse proxy in
# your web server (e.g. apache or nginx), so all requests to /_matrix on port
# 443 and 8448 will be forwarded to the matrixon instance running on this port
# Docker users: Don't change this, you'll need to map an external port to this.
port = 8008

# Max size for uploads
max_request_size = 20_000_000 # in bytes

# Enables registration. If set to false, no users can register on this server.
allow_registration = true

# A static registration token that new users will have to provide when creating
# an account. YOU NEED TO EDIT THIS.
# - Insert a password that users will have to enter on registration
# - Start the line with '#' to remove the condition
registration_token = ""

allow_check_for_updates = true
allow_federation = true

# Enable the display name lightning bolt on registration.

# Servers listed here will be used to gather public keys of other servers.
# Generally, copying this exactly should be enough. (Currently, matrixon doesn't
# support batched key requests, so this list should only contain Synapse
# servers.)

[global.well_known]
# matrixon handles the /.well-known/matrix/* endpoints, making both clients and servers try to access matrixon with the host
# server_name and port 443 by default.
# If you want to override these defaults, uncomment and edit the following lines accordingly:
#server = your.server.name:443
#client = https://your.server.name
