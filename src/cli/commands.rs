// Description:
//   Command-line interface implementation. This module is part of the Matrixon Matrix NextServer
//   implementation, designed for enterprise-grade deployment with 20,000+
//   concurrent connections and <50ms response latency.
//
// Performance Targets:
//   • 20k+ concurrent connections
//   • <50ms response latency
//   • >99% success rate
//   • Memory-efficient operation
//   • Horizontal scalability
//
// Features:
//   • CLI command handling
//   • Interactive user interface
//   • Command validation and parsing
//   • Help and documentation
//   • Administrative operations
//
// Architecture:
//   • Async/await native implementation
//   • Zero-copy operations where possible
//   • Memory pool optimization
//   • Lock-free data structures
//   • Enterprise monitoring integration
//
// Dependencies:
//   • Tokio async runtime
//   • Structured logging with tracing
//   • Error handling with anyhow/thiserror
//   • Serialization with serde
//   • Matrix protocol types with ruma
